## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Investoria  
- **Short Description:** Educational platform that helps users learn investing by practicing with real time market data as well as historical data. Users can simulate trades on past events, analyze their decisions, and improve their financial literacy. The platform also supports group features, where users can collaborate, share strategies, and learn together.  
- **Problem Statement:** Many beginners struggle to learn investing because real markets are risky, fast-moving, and require capital. Existing learning tools are either too theoretical or lack a collaborative aspect. There is a need for an accessible and safe environment where users can practice investment strategies on real data, while also benefiting from group learning and peer feedback.  

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Provide an interactive platform for learning investing without financial risk.
- Enable users to simulate trades using real time market data as well as historical data.
- Support group learning where users can track progress and share strategies.
- Improve financial literacy and decision-making skills through practice.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Primary Users:** Students, beginner investors, individuals interested in learning investing. 
- **Secondary Users:** Group mentors, educators, or community organizers who facilitate learning.

## 4. Business Context
- **Current Situation:** Most learning happens through theory, books, or real markets, which can be risky and expensive. 
- **Proposed Solution:** Provide a safe environment with past market data and group collaboration, bridging the gap between theory and real practice.

## 5. Scope
- **In Scope:**  
  - Real time and historical market data simulations
  - User profiles and progress tracking
  - Group creation and collaboration features

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Real-money trading
  - Advanced financial instruments (options, derivatives, etc.) in the first version of the application 

## 6. Business Processes / Use Cases
  - A user registers, creates investing account/s, joins a group, and starts practicing.
  - Groups track collective performance, discuss strategies, and compare outcomes.
  - Users review their past trades to identify strengths and mistakes.

## 7. Expected Benefits
  - **For Users:** Learn investing in a practical but risk-free environment; gain confidence before entering real markets.
  - **For Groups:** Shared progress encourages motivation, teamwork, and peer learning.
  - **For Education:** Provides an engaging tool that can complement classroom teaching.  

## 8. Risks & Assumptions
- **Assumptions:**  
  - Users have basic internet access and interest in learning about investing.
  - The platform is designed as an educational tool, not a full investment service.
  - Users understand the system provides only the essential elements of investing, presented in a simplified way.
    
- **Risks:**
  - Limited time/resources may restrict feature development.
  - The application depends on external services (e.g., APIs providing market data). While it is expected to work reliably most of the time ( 99% ), outages or changes in those services could affect availability and accuracy.
